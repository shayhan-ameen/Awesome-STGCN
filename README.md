## Introduction
**Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (STGCNs)** integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with temporal models (such as RNNs or CNNs) to capture complex dependencies in spatio-temporal data. These models have been widely used in various domains, including:

- **Traffic flow prediction**
- **Human skeleton-based action recognition**
- **Climate forecasting**
- **Network security anomaly detection**

This list brings together key resources for learning, implementing, and advancing STGCN models.
